        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A crêpe or crepe is a dish made from unleavened batter or dough that is cooked on a frying pan or a griddle. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: sweet crêpes or savoury galettes. .</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter (melted)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. </li>
            <li>Add flour and melted butter. </li>
            <li>Whisk vigorously until batter is smooth and pourable.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.</li>
